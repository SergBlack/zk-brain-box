## Add new note
- `Ctrl + O` -> enter the name of the note (at the same time looking in the database), if didnâ€™t find anything, create it
- Apply template [[_new_note]]
- Add [[#Type tags]] and [[#Status tags]]
- If a new link is added - press `Ctrl + Click` and create a new note

## Principles
- All notes are placed in the "base" folder and then  in a subfolder (if you need)
- Notes with a link are best opened with a local graph
- Sometimes it will be helpful to open a random note and think about links

## Search
- Use `Ctrl + O` -> base -> topic -> links (or local graph)

## Folders
- "base" - all notes
- "daily" - daily notes
- "files" - all files from notes
- "templates" - all templates

## Status tags
- #status-in-progress - something to work on 
- #status-done - worked-out or completed ideas
- #status-not-relevant - wrong or reworked ideas

## Type tags
- #common - common notes
- #clouds - cloud technologies
- #web - web technologies
