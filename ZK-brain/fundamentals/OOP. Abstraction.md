# OOP. Abstraction
We can look at class as a `black-box` with `joystick` where it's not important to understand it's implementation but we get benefits of using it.

More formally - we are abstracting away the implementation details of a class and only presenting a clean, easy-to-use interface via methods.

**Pros**: Abstraction helps isolate changes made to the code - if you need some changes in class then its affect only the implementation of a class and not the outside code, because we don't change public methods.

## Example
Stereo systems, phone, PC and so on.
