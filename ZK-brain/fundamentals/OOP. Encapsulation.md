# OOP. Encapsulation
When we hide/protect/enclose something.

We hide private details of a class from outside (data and methods that operate on that data). When a class doesn't allow to get private data - we can say it's well encapsulated.

**Pros**: We can protect some data.

## Example
If we have a class `Customer` and private field `SocialNumber`. We encapsulate it as a private field with no outside access. But we can operate on it with methods of the same class and not provide direct access from other parts of the code.
